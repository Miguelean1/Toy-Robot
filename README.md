# R.O.V.E.R. simulator 🚀 

Operate a R.O.V.E.R. over the Mars surface to collaborate with NASA in obtaining precious information about the martian land and deploy walls to help in the scientific research. Hope you enjoy it!

## The concept 🎆

The idea was quite simple: we had been working on a technical trial during our design class on DAW. After almost finishing the mechanics, our teacher Paloma invited us to make the final adjusts on our own. Each one of us had to wake up this toy-robot with our own spark. So my approach has been to recreate the R.O.V.E.R. landing on Mars. Hope you like it

Possible features to think on:
- Create a adaptative board.
- Work on the accesibility of the project.
- Implement a gaming competitive mechanic.
